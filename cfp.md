## (Preliminary) Call for Papers
**Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph and Ontology Engineering**<br />
*2024 AAAI Fall Symposium*

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are highly trending. The interplay between these two technologies can go both ways, but the two directions are quite different in approach. This symposium specifically focuses on how LLMs can be used as tools to augment the extant capacity for ontology and knowledge graph engineering. Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE) and Ontology Engineering (OE â€“ together KG/OE) challenges in particular have to do with the (to date still) high involvement of humans and human expert in the KG/OE life cycle, including creation/modeling, alignment, evolution, reusability (from both ontological commitment and accessibility perspectives). The KG/OE communities have made steady progress in the past 20 years, but only now with LLMs, key KG/OE challenges appear to become addressable at scale. 

The goal of this symposium to focus and coordinate research. We wish to create a space and foundational community for the sharing of ideas for prompt engineering, fine-tuning, neurosymbolic approaches, quality control, and human-in-the-loop methods: all with LLMs for OE/KGE.

**Topics** include, but are not limited to:
* LLMs for Knowledge Graph and Ontology Creation
* LLMs for Ontology and Entity Mapping
* LLMs for Knowledge Graph and Ontology Evolution
* LLMs for Knowledge Graph access and use
* LLMs as Natural Language Interfaces for Knowledge Graphs and Ontologies

**Format** of the Symposium:
The program will consist of presentations of accepted full papers, posters, lightning talks, keynotes, and significant time for panel and plenary discussions.

**Submission** of papers:
Full papers (for oral presentation): 8-10 pages (not counting references).
Short papers (for poster presentation): 3-4 pages (not counting references).
Lightning talks (for brief spotlight presentation): 1-2 pages extended abstract (not counting references). 
Submissions are to be made via the official AAAI Symposium Easychair site.
